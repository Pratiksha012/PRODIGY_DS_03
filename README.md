## Objective
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In my notebook, I have created a Decision Tree Classifier model that can predict whether a customer will purchase a product or a service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

The overall accuracy of the model is 87.40%, which is the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.

True Positive (TP): 526
True Negative (TN): 7378
False Positive (FP): 574
False Negative (FN): 565

The model performs well in predicting the majority class ("no") but shows some limitations in predicting the minority class ("yes").
The relatively lower precision, recall, and F1-score for the "yes" class indicate that the model has challenges correctly identifying instances of the "yes" class.
